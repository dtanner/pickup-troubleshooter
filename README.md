- maybe go both ways. e.g. root causes, their symptoms and cures. and starting from a symptom, get to root cause
- frequency ranges
- symptoms of different types of interference. e.g. if it's radio, you can hear the radio
- guitar shielding. what to shield, what not to. what it helps with and what it doesn't help with. copper foil vs paint
- line vs air
- for line, power filters
- for air, directional
- frequencies of different types of interference
- sounds of different types of interference
- ways to investigate and analyze the issue (triangulate, turn off switches, try different locations in the house, try different locations outside the house)
- tools. EMF detectors, battery-powered amps
- resources. power company (link to samurai guitarist example), my experience with power company
